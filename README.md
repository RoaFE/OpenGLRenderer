# OpenGLRenderer

An basic probably quite messy openGL renderer for just messing around in and experimenting with OpenGL. Based off of the Cherno OpenGL series and LearnOpenGL.com.

Was originally built as a basic renderer for my honours project but decided to abstract it into a more generic renderer.
