# OpenGLRenderer

An basic probably quite messy openGL renderer for just messing around in and experimenting with OpenGL. Based off of the Cherno OpenGL series and LearnOpenGL.com.

Was originally built as a basic renderer for my honours project but decided to abstract it into a more generic renderer.


# TODO

* Add lighting
* Be able to create and edit textures rather than just load them in
* Expand upon the utility class to include more generic functions and maths
  * Screen to world space
  * Vector maths for glm::vectors
* Experiment with IMGUI
* Render Textures
